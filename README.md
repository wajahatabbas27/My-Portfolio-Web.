### Group

## GET-FORM.io

- using the get form.io when ever a user submits a form, data is received on the inbox of gmail and it is connected to getform.io.
- It is a good service where we can be updated of everything through the gmail and also in the inbox of the getform account which we created .

- All we have to do is just to paste the url of the http provided by getform.io in the form attribute as well as the method="POST" as its POST request.
