- Applying css in index.css -- calling the fonts here and applying in the whole application

### Navbar

- navbar completed fully responsive navbar completed with toggle button and the cross button and working on the different screens as applied on md screen as it shows the bars icon when the medium screen sized reached.
- while the logic is created just by the useState hook and by using the ternary operator in the return statement.

## social components fixed

- applying the transition by giving margin left to it more than half the width and on the hover taking back to the original place

### Group

- If i want to hover over a button we want to move the arrow as well so we need to create the group as well in te button and mention in the span element as well.

### Grids

- Exploring grids as well so first of all we create a div and initialize the grid class in it as it is the main div therefore after it we will going to apply the class of the grid-cols-2 -- if we wanted 2 coloums in the same grid now we can create the div in the main div to apply all of these things,
  the main reason to create is to define the structure for us.
